## My process

### Features

- **Centered card layout** with responsive spacing
- **CSS custom properties** for colors and easy theming
- **Decorative background patterns** positioned using multiple background images
- **Profile image overlay** using absolute positioning and transforms
- **Semantic HTML structure** (`header`, `section`, `footer`)
- **Reusable utility classes** for typography and color
- **Reduced motion support** using `prefers-reduced-motion`

### What I Learned

---

#### Accessibility

- Structured content semantically to improve screen reader support.
- Used `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries to respect user accessibility preferences.
- Ensured readable font sizes and sufficient color contrast.

#### Modern CSS

- Used **CSS custom properties** to manage colors consistently across the project.
- Applied **multiple background images** with precise positioning for decorative effects.
- Leveraged **absolute positioning and transforms** to center the avatar image cleanly.
- Implemented a modern CSS reset for predictable cross-browser styling.

#### Component Styling

- Created a **modular card component** with clear visual separation between sections.
- Styled a **statistics footer** using flexbox for even spacing and alignment.
- Applied subtle shadows and rounded corners for depth and polish.
- Used pseudo-elements (`::before`) to inject decorative header backgrounds without extra markup.

#### Best Practices

- Mobile-first approach with flexible units and responsive spacing.
- Clean, readable class naming using a component-based convention.
- Organized CSS into logical sections: variables, reset, layout, components, and utilities.
